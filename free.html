        <h1>THE FREE GIFT</h1>
        <p>
<b>SALVATION!</b> What an amazing gift from God: "the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23b" <br>
There is forgiveness through the blood of Jesus.” It is not a reward for our services; it is the gift of God through Jesus Christ. <br>
It is not given because we are worthy to receive it, but because it is a gift worthy of God to give. John 3:16. <br>
The gospel of salvation is just this: <br>
 <b>A simple offer on God’s side and simple acceptance on ours!</b> <br>
A gift we do not deserve as a wretched sinner, but made qualified to possess once we have confessed Jesus Christ as our Lord and personal saviour. <br>
The reason Jesus came to this world- His birth we are celebrating today! <br>
He- Jesus Christ was crucified so that “whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16)-paid our debt <br>
Rose up on the third day and back to heaven to prepare a place for us. 1 Corinthians 2:9 <br>
You are urged to accept this precious gift. Do not hesitate; only believe! Matthew 6:33 <br>
These are the results of salvation in Christ. <br>
Your first step is confident acceptance of an offer that is free, generous, and unconditional.  <br>
<b>It is completely free!</b>  <br>
What can be more sure or more free than this? <br>
Salvation without money,  Salvation without price,<br>
Salvation for the guilty, Salvation for the lost; <br>
Salvation for the wretched, The sad and tempest-tossed. <br>
Our sins were borne by Jesus, The Substitute from God; <br>
He took them all, and freed us from sin’s accursed load. <br>
Our guilt was borne by Jesus, Who washed the crimson stains
White in His blood most precious, <br>
<b>Until no spot remains.</b>  <br>
<h1>Accept Jesus Christ Today!</h1>
